## Why Use Untrace?

Modern images contain hidden data that can compromise your privacy:

- **Location data** reveals where photos were taken
- **AI signatures** show which tools generated images
- **Device info** identifies your camera/phone
- **Timestamps** reveal when images were created

Untrace removes all this data while keeping your images looking exactly the same.
